# projects-heating-optimization-mvp





Welcome to this repo focused on the topic of building heating. It consists of applying various data science skills in this domain:

- modelling & parameter estimation for proposing thermal response
- using pyomo to learn how to handle an optimisation problem
- ue a gym environment to learn RL in this case
